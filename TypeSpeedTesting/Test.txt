The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
The early bird catches the worm.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
